ros-rolling-gscam (0.2.0-4noble) noble; urgency=high

  * add ROS Orphaned Package Maintainers to maintainer tag (#35 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam/issues/35> )
  * gscam_nodelet.h: include scoped_ptr.hpp to compile with boost 1.57
    When compiling gscam with the currently latest boost version 1.57,
    it fails with:
    In file included from [...]/src/gscam_nodelet.cpp:5:0:
    [...]/include/gscam/gscam_nodelet.h:20:12: error: 'scoped_ptr' in namespace 'boost' does not name a template type
    boost::scoped_ptr<GSCam> gscam_driver_;
    ^
    [...]/include/gscam/gscam_nodelet.h:21:12: error: 'scoped_ptr' in namespace 'boost' does not name a template type
    boost::scoped_ptr<boost::thread> stream_thread_;
    ^
    It seems that the dependencies of boost/thread.hpp have changed
    and boost/scoped_ptr.hpp is not included anymore with
    boost/thread.hpp. Hence, the scoped_ptr is not defined in the
    gscam_nodelet header. After scanning quickly through the release
    notes of version 1.57, the boost bug tracker and a few changesets,
    I could not find not a hint what has changed in the thread library
    that gscam must include scoped_ptr itself.
    This commit simply addresses the compiler error by explicitly
    adding boost's scoped_ptr header in the gscam_nodelet header.
    As this commit also compiles with boost version 1.56, the commit
    is not expected to cause any problems with other build
    configurations.

  * Remove dependency on opencv2 to fix under indigo
    Packages can no longer depend on opencv2 as of indigo.
    I've updated the package to depend instead on cv_bridge as suggested by http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Migration#OpenCV.
  * Install the parameters file refered to in v4l.launch
  * Update package.xml
  * Examples: Added example for OSX (#15 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam/issues/15>)
    Add a simple launch configuration for OSX. The camera can be selected by
    changing the default="0" to the appropriate integer.
  * Adding libraries to gscam target
    Fixes #13 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam/issues/13>, now builds on stricter linkers
  * adding proper depends to catkin package call
  * Update minoru.launch

    Added a bunch of enhancements and fixed bugs involving data
    missing fromthe image message headers.
    Index: src/gscam.cpp
    ===================================================================
    Added ``camera_name`` and ``camera_parameters_file`` globals for camera
    info.
    Moved ros init to the top of the main function.
    Gets the gstreamer configuration either from environment variable
    ``GSCAM_CONFIG`` or ROS param ``~/gscam_config``.
    Gets the camera calibration parameters from the file located at ROS
    param ``~/camera_parameters_file``, will look at
    "../camera_settings.txt" by default.
    A bunch of re-indenting for consistency.
    Updated a lot of error fprintfs to ``ROS_ERROR`` calls.
    Gets the TF ``frame_id`` from the ROS param ``~/frame_id``, can be over-
    written by camera parameters.
    Now sets the appropriate ROS timestap in the image message header.
    Now sets the appropriate TF frame in the image message header.
    Added more detailed info/error/warn messages.
    Modified the warning / segfault avoidance added to experimental in
    r2756. Instead of skipping the frame, it just copies only the
    amount of data that it was received, and reports the warning each
    time, instead of just once. In a large scale system with lots of
    messages, a single warning might easily get lost in the noise.
    Index: examples/webcam_parameters.txt
    ===================================================================
    Added example camera parameters (uncalibrated) for a laptop webcam.
    Index: examples/webcam.launch
    ===================================================================
    Added a launchfile that makes use of the new rosparam options and
    TF frame.
  * avoid segfault when buffer size is too small
  * ROSProcessingjs clean-up
  * makefile so rosmake is more reliable
  * gscam build tweak for oneiric
  * fixes for Natty build per Willow request
  * stop node on EOS
  * File support courtesy of John Hoare of the University of Tennesse at Knoxville
  * more conservative license policy
  * fps workaround
  * ding gscam
  * back to before
  * two publishers
  * Lots of changes.  AR Alpha now expects files in the bin directory, to facilitate roslaunch.  Gscam must be started from the bin directory, or, again, using roslaunch.  The localizer code now works correctly and has been tested on a Create, but has problems cause by AR alpha's processing delays.
  * Bugfix: supply default camera parameters when real ones are unavailable.
  * Fully-functional calibration file writing.
  * Partial changes for file-writing gscam.
  * Gscam now fits into an image processing pipeline with rectified images.  TODO: Save camera configuration info.
  * Handles built for camera info services, but no testing.
  * Changed the name of the GStreamer camera package.  probe will henceforth be known as gscam.
